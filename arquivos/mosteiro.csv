Murray F,So we waited in line for the monastery to find out we had to go next door to buy tickets there. Our bad for not researching. When I got to the auto payment machine I picked the family option and paid $15 E for th tickets. Before I could get the tickets a lady who worked there grabbed them from the machine and refused to hand them over saying I hadn‚Äôt paid enough. She didn‚Äôt even know what family I had. She refused to give them over till I payed more. If she was a guy I would have thumped him I reckon. She was rude and obnoxious and we ended up paying double for a very ordinary tour. Reading this chain of reviews she‚Äôs had similar antics but never been held to account. And this is a monastery!! üòÇ,"Written July 8, 2022","Mosman, Australia",Scammed at ticket booth

After mass ended and we'd finally gained entry we stayed with some other tourists seeing the paintings and art work as I walked past a door a man came running in shouting 'everyone get out' so we were aggressively thrown out. We had just one day in Lisbon and that morning was to see the bellem Tower and monastery, this treatment in a Christian establishment was uncalled for. Portuguese were ushered in after a few words about attending mass, though clearly they too were tourists, I was met with a blank stare when I said 'I'm Catholic can I attend Mass too?' we were very respectful and took part in the mass.","Written May 24, 2022",6 contributions,Not worth it

Please buy your ticket online as you will otherwise need to get this separately on the day and wait in two long lines!  Fast track does not mean you go in quicker.  Just be careful as there are some dodgy websites.  The ticket price at time of writing April 2022, for a basic adult ticket is ‚Ç¨10.00.  The architecture and detail is just breathtaking.  You can also appreciate it better by going early when it is less crowded.  My main negative is that there is limited information and I was kicking myself that I forgot my guide book!  You will end up doing what me and most people were doing and that was looking, admiring and taking photographs but missing the important detail.  After you have finished, go to Past√©is de Bel√©m which is a two minute walk away and then the Bel√©m Tower which is less than twenty minutes by foot.

Jos√© M,"The river front of the Jer√≥nimos monastery and the Bel√©m church are an amazing view in themselves. In every weather and at all hours the high walls fantastically carved out of white stone with curious manueline seafaring details are suggestive of the lost beach at their feet from where the caravels would once have sailed off, Godspeed mass having been chanted with the monks. Getting inside the church, its noble spaciousness and unique proportions seem appropriate to the tombs of many famous Portuguese linked to the pioneer oversea expeditions. The whole place is intimately connected with those adventurous times. The high vaults seem to linger on a different, spiritual plane, not so much supported by the surprisingly slender and elegant columns as retained by them like by so many tight cables to prevent that giant white sail from floating away in the breeze. Surely a Zeppelin above one‚Äôs head wouldn‚Äôt feel as light as this huge stony horizontal surface. The simplicity of the choir built later in the understated elegance of the ‚ÄúPortuguese plain style‚Äù is breathtakingly beautiful in its perfect proportions and blends in just so. The museums now contained in the monastery are small and interesting especially for children as you have a few Egyptian rooms with the usual captivating things as well as treasure rooms with plenty impressive Celtic and Tartessian gold torques.

The structure is 300 meters in length, the exterior is intricately decorated and the  interior is also impressive with its altars, tombs and stained glass. In earlier years it was associated with explorers and sailors and is the resting place of Vasco de Gama. If you travel independently you are required to purchase your tickets in a separate building at machines that occasionally break down, then get into another long line to enter. Best to purchase your entrance on line. Better management is required here, it can be frustrating. You can also visit Santa Maria church attached to the monastery. The admission is free. Another must attraction while in this vicinity is the Explorer monument and Belem Tower. The gardens here could use some landscaping.

AJAY S,I visited Lisbon with my family in October 2019. Among all the sites we visited Jeronimos Monastery was definitely the most remarkable. The stunning Manueline style architecture design gives it a very unique look. Built to honor Portugal's role in the Age of discovery mainly India by Vasco Da Gama it also has his tomb inside the Santa Maria Church. It is located near the riverfront of Belem and within walking distance to two other attractions of Lisbon - Pastel De Belem and Monument of Discoveries. ,"Written November 2, 2019","Mumbai, India",Must see attraction in Lisbon

Make sure you go there first, especially on a hot day. There are only a few ticket machines, so the queues can be quite long. After that, don't make the mistake and queue again - go straight to the entrance and show your tickets. The queue is most likely the one to the church. You will, however, have to queue there again once you're done with the monastery and want to have a look at the church. By the time you come back, they might have changed the entrance to the church.

Jonathan M,"The Mosteiro dos Jeronimos almost didn't make it onto our Lisbon itinerary but I am so, so glad that it did. Belem is a 20 minute bus ride from the heart of Lisbon and the 728 bus will drop you off right in front of the monastery. There was a mass of people waiting to enter the Santa Maria church, which is free, but if you want to enter the cloister of the monastery, and believe me, you definitely do, you need to head to the next entrance to the west to purchase your ticket, then return to the church entrance, where you will be directed to the cloister. Walking into the sun-bathed cloister courtyard took my breath away. Even though there were quite a few visitors on the Friday morning we were there, they faded from view as the exquisite sun-drenched cloister took all of my attention. What at first seem to be very uniform and repeated patterns on further inspection are revealed to be in fact innumerable variations on themes that would take hours to study in detail. The light and shadow created unforgettable colors and hues that photographs just don't capture accurately. The second level  provided access to the balcony of the church but the church offered darkness and constriction while the cloister offered brilliant light and serenity. There was also a very informative historical exhibit which provided context by showing the history of the monastery, the history of Portugal, and world history in parallel on a timeline. There are also several adjacent galleries that can be visited, but nothing comes close to the perfection of the cloister. Enter, sit down, relax, contemplate, leave refreshed.","Written June 16, 2019","Tuxedo Park, NY",Dazzling and Intricate Architecture

Donegalabu,"It was Sunday and, after visiting the building to the explorers and the Torre, we then went to Jeronimo's monestery. The tram from the city centre stops directly outside the monestery. There are two entrances, one to the chapel and one to the exhibition. We chose to go into the chapel and were delighted with our choice. There was a queue for mass and a queue to go in and see the chapel. Although we are Catholics, we thought we were late for mass and so joined the other queue. There was a man at the door who, very respectfully, goes through an introduction to the chapel and the rules of the chapel. This is in stark contrast to other cities where people are shouting rules at you as you enter. The main area of the church was cordoned off as mass was on-going, but there was a prayer area that we joined. From there, we participated in the mass. There was a lady who, once again very respectfully and in a very friendly way, asks what your language is, then goes and gets the prayers in your language for you. At the sign of peace, a few of the people working there, come and shake hands with you. The whole experience was very inclusive and welcoming and it struck me, that is exactly how it should be, warmly welcoming people to our religion. I loved the whole experience here.

JD1,"The exterior is stunning. It is free to enter church but you cannot see other interior or museum without a ticket. If you are looking at the front of the monastery the tickets can be purchased at the door on the far left. Children 12 and under are free. Adults were 12e each. You begin in the museum. You are told to put all (including purse) belongings in a locker (need 1e which you did back get at end). First part of museum is general history of area and includes egyptian and middle age, bronze age. Then you cross entry to other part of museum. Several sarcoghogus on display, mummified animals, sculptures, early writing etc. After you complete the museum you collect belongings and go back out and over to main part of monestary. Enter church and walk all around/take pictures. If you have a ticket you can enter the interior of the monestary. There is a beautiful courtyard with amazing architecture. There are some interior displays, crypts, etc. You can also enter second floor of church with your ticket. Overall very beautiful. We got there right when it opened and there was no line. Around 10:45 there were long lines. Later we saw about 15 tour buses. After you leave monestary you need to eat the original Pastel de Nata at Pateis de Belem which is just down the street (the recipe was developed by the monks and later sold). They have a full lunch menu and coffee and desserts. The line on right is to order take out the line on left is to get a table. It is huge inside but like a maze. Walk all around and grab an empty table and someone will come over. The house of the President (pink house) is just down street too. We were able to see changing of the guard. Nearby are several museums, Belem Tower  and a Large statue where the original navigators left Portugal from to explore the new world (Prado Dos Des Com Brimentos ). There is not a Metro station in this area. We took an Uber and the driver was very nice and helpful. There is plenty to do and see. If you are walking you need to use one of the pedestrian bridges to cross the road/tram stations to get to tower and water.","Written January 22, 2019","Greenville, SC",Get there early or Get there late!

Erin B,"Husband and I did a fair amount of research for visiting and followed the advice of others to get in line for the Museum and purchase a combo ticket from one of the several kiosks available once you get into the building (you will have to stand in line for the kiosks, but it's not as long as the general Monastery line). The kiosks take credit card and you will want to purchase a combo ticket for both the museum and the monastery. Once you do, you can either head directly to the Museum (we did not, because it was relatively small and we were short on time) or skip the Museum and get in the expedited line for the Monastery. The process is a bit confusing, so don't be afraid to ask questions or confirm with others that you are standing in the right line before waiting an extended period of time, only to find out that you are in the wrong line. Once inside, you will be treated to the wide open walkways of the monastery and a central square with beautiful architecture and elaborate moldings and cornices. Make sure not to miss the attached cathedral, which has the tomb of Vasco De Gama. It's free to the public, but you can skip the long line by getting in the line that accepts the combo ticket for the Museum and Monastery. Again, ask questions and don't be afraid to be a little kind but firm with the world-weary guards, many of them who aren't interested in dealing with your limited knowledge of Portuguese. Overall, a pleasant way to spend an afternoon and lots of great photo opps. You will need to bring your patience, however, this is a prime tourist spot so lots of people from different cultures coming together, with everyone trying to get the best photo and not being very aware of their surroundings. Keep a mellow attitude and try to embrace the peace and history of the locale and you will be fine.","Written December 18, 2018","Seattle, WA",Beautiful Must-See Lisbon Attraction

Vitor A,This monastery was built during the Manuel‚Äôs kingdom. At the time Portugal was quite a rich country due to the trade of spices brought mainly from India. The most important at the time was pepper going 5% of the profits to the king who built the huge monastery with that money. The decorative style is called Manueline - between the Gothic and the Renaissance. Be sure that you visit the church and the cloister ‚Äì this is one of the most beautiful in Europe.

There was a significant queue even on a rainy October day.  You can purchase tickets for about 2 euros more at a ticket vendor about a block away and bypass the queue but if you have the day out pass you have to stand in the queue to get inside.  It costs around 10-12 euro to get in or included with the Lisbon day out pass.  Discount for students and over 65.  Once inside there are stone stairs and uneven cobbles so not terribly handicap friendly.  We got fun photos and I recommend going off season so it isn‚Äôt so crowded inside.  You can walk a block to the armory tower from here and the nearby Starbucks is especially nice for pastries. We took the 128 bus to get there with no trouble but returning to city center during rush hour gave us overcrowded buses. The bus 15 will get you back but requires patience.

We beat the queues by buying combined tickets (Belem Tower too) from the Archiological Museum just a minute or two walk away: no queue at all and the helpful lady at the ticket desk said we were allowed to just walk in now we had tickets. There was virtually no queue to get into the church from the main entrance and after viewing the church (wow!) we just seemed to follow a tour group through into the cloisters, having our ticket checked just as we entered. Others have mentioned you can enter via a side exit, provided you have already bought a ticket and it did look like this would be a quick way in via the shop, but we didn't actually try that way.","Written October 18, 2018","Shrewsbury, UK",Awesome architrcture

The monastery is a stunning model of Manueline architectural style. This unique Portuguese design combines Gothic, Moorish and Renaissance styles with nautical themes. In the church we could see the tombs of Vasco da Gama, the first European to reach India by sea and Luis de cam√µes, the great poet of the Discoveries, Also we could see tombs of King Manuel I and his wife queen Mary of Aragon, daughter of the Spanish Catholic Kings Isabel and Ferdinand, as well of his son king John III, and his wife Catherine of Austria, younger sister of Emperor Charles V.","Written October 3, 2018","Lisbon, Portugal",Jeronimos Monastery or Monastery of St. Mary of Bethlem

Catherine C,"We arrived at the Monastery mid morning along with a large number of tour buses. Unfortunately all the Belem sights now involve encounters with hawkers trying to sell selfie sticks, sunglasses and other paraphernalia. The large number of tourists was disconcerting however we were determined to see the Monastery. I had heard that tickets could be purchased at the next door museum so we went there first. There were only about 10 people ahead of us in the ticketing queue whereas there were seemingly hundreds trying to get tickets at the monastery. We had no problems getting tickets - Monastery tickets were available for 10‚Ç¨, Museum tickets were available for 5‚Ç¨ and a combo ticket could be purchased for 12‚Ç¨. Tower tickets were also available. Monastery tickets in hand, we went back to the entrance, past the increasing lines, showed our tickets to the attendant and were immediately allowed to enter! The Monastery is beautiful and well worth the entry fee. You have to exit the Monastery and then join another queue to enter the Church. This was a quick process as admission is free. The Church was full of tourists and tour guides but the Sacristy was relatively quiet - probably because it has a separate 1.5‚Ç¨ admission fee. It was a great visit overall - moreso because we didn‚Äôt have to queue in the sun for an hour or more to get admission tickets!

There is one room in the monastery that is devoted to all the events or creations (music, literature, science) that have affected the world, Portugal and the Jeronimos monastery...in three tiers. It‚Äôs incredible how they have done this and it‚Äôs extremely absorbing. The gift shop too unlike such gift shops is very reasonably priced.

lemotka,Visited the monastery and the church mid August . The queue to get in was  a killer and we wasted nearly 2 hours roasting under the sun. The secret is to get a ticket to the next door Archeological museum ( no queue ! ) that also gives you access to the monastery ... but then again there is absolutely no one to tell you that . The monastery ticket office had only one kiosk working and serving hundreds of people . Not good. The monastery itself is spectacular but there is very little information about it inside . You better have a guide book with you or use Google to learn more about it . The church is free and it is absolutely magnificent . There is the final resting place of one of the greatest explorers Vasco Da Gama.  A must see. ,"Written August 17, 2018",United Kingdom,Hell on a hot day but worth it

I think if we had direct entry without this long queue in the sun we would have appreciated the monastery better. There is no doubt that it's beautiful place to visit but had I known how it looks I wouldn't make such a touristy effort for it.  Tips: Don't buy Lisbon pass, it felt like a waste, since everyone buys it and everyone queues. Unless you can really make the best of it all in 24/48 hours whatever that is, it's a waste of money.

You also get to see the huge balcony of the church, which acutally is for free, but only the lower part, but more worth seeing in my opinion.","Written July 5, 2018","Hannover, Germany","Nice, but church next to it better"

The line was very long to get into the building (about 1 hour) and also endured the hawkers selling souvenirs while you waited.  During the wait, we had ample opportunity to admire the building - which had lots of carvings.  Inside the building (Lisboa card gave free entry) was even better than the outside.  A great architectural masterpiece.  Around the cloisters, there were rooms which had exhibitions in them that were very interesting.  After the monastery we visited the other sights in Belem and when we came back in the afternoon, there was no line.  Consequently, we suggest that they other sights in Belem are visited first and then come back to the monastery to avoid a line-up.","Written July 4, 2018",Brisbane,Amazing Ornate Building

The style of the building in its own is unique and one of my personal favourites. Its called the Manueline Style, awesome old church and monastery that has survived the great earthquake of 1755 which destroyed 80% of the city, followed by a widespread fire and 2 tsunamis! Here lies the tombs of great navigator Vasco da Gama and of the greatest writer in the Portuguese language Cam√µes. That is a big deal since Portuguese is the 6th most spoken language in the world!

johnrkesslerjr,"This large white limestone church and Cloister is impressive inside and out.  As you arrive the church is about 900 feet long and three stories high.  This complex was started in the late 1490's and is blend of gothic and mudejur (Moorish) architecture. The carved stonework is beautiful.  It is ornate, elaborate and blended together.  There is a definite nautical theme complemented by many coat-of-arms throughout.  The Cloister is a highlight.  The stone carvings are lacy, yet are complemented by numerous gargoyles.  There are a number of ornately carved crypts, including one with Vasco Da Game. Spend time in the kitchen/refectory with its huge ovens, the Chapter room and the cloister's sacristy.  This site is highly recommended especially if you like exceptional craftsmanship.   If the ticket line is long, go next door to the Maritime Museum and buy a ticket for both sites for +1 euro and go to the head of the line for the church and cloister.

Brain_bleed_md,"This regal monastery is in Belem which requires a tram or bus journey if you are staying in the city center. But it is something you must see if you are in Lisbon - with amazing examples of Manueline architecture and historic artefacts (both the tomb of Fernado Pessoa and Vasco de Gama). It can have very long lines on weekends and even other days (although it does move quickly) so either go early or buy a combined ticket with the archeological museum next door and (after visiting that for 30 minutes) you can walk right to the front of the monastery line. You can also visit the main church from a entrance to the side of the main entrance without a ticket (or, as we did, on the way out of the monastery). Inside, you find a lovely cloister and regal halls. They even had a very decent exhibit that showed (in parallel) the history of Portugal, the world, and the monastery. This is the ""Notre Dame"" of Portugal - and should be revered for its architecture just like that is.

Oxana N,"First of all, buy your ticket online to avoid long unnecessary queues. We arrived here for the opening at 10am and had to stay in a queue for an hour to get inside. Be aware that the cathedral next to the monastery is free of charge while you have to buy the tickets for the monastery. BUT there is no easy connection from monastery to the cathedral. You have to get out and join another queue to get into the cathedral (which is not long but still frustrating). The amount of people in the narrow entrance creates chaos and unnecessary stress. So I recommend to buy the tickets to the monastery online, visit the cathedral first and then go directly to the monastery. You won't have to line with all 200 people.

Rebaubau,"Although I am a local I never tire of visiting the church and the cloisters, it is the memoir of our golden age and on top os it, a magnificent example of the Portuguese Renaissance. It also has the tomb of our greatest poet, who wrote the odyssey of the Portuguese in verse and the tomb of the great Portuguese hero Vasco da Gama, who managed to fecha India by sea, changing the world for ever. In the church the tombs of royal family members seat on marble elephants, something exotic for the time and in the wonderful cloisters you can see despicted for the first time in a monument the ephigy of a black man. The cloisters are unusually elaborate, this is because the royal family of the time used it for functions and the 1rst floor of the long part of the building was also used as a royal residence. Our queen Catherine, married to John III was the first to be shown the wonderful objects coming from the orient the moment they went ashore and she was even the first queen to have fans which came from China!

And in case you work up a hunger, across the street, on top the museum is a rooftop restaurant that is very good -- with views to match and a nice breeze from the river.","Written May 30, 2018","Saint Louis, MO",This 16th century structure demonstrates Portugal's global leadership at that time.

I have seen other monesteraries before and this is a very pretty one but all the same it wasn't worth the wait. We arrived at 9.50 (the monestary opens at 10am) and there was already a big queue. It took 1 hour 20 mins to get in. I don't know if it was possible to buy a ticket in advance but we assumed not. There were loads of tour groups that seemed to walk straight in and didn't queue.

No. Queued for the best part of an hour (Saturday lunchtime) in the full sun, whilst continually being pestered by women trying to sell cheap necklaces and shawls. The queue moved at a snail's pace.

The play was amusing and entertaining, appropriate to the monastery setting without being ""preachy."" And, as with many ancient churches, the interior of the church itself was beautiful and in ways humbling. The entry line was long but moved steadily.

Adam47Kingston_UK,"Having just returned from Lisbon, I thought it worthwhile sharing our experience visiting the Jeronimus Monastery at Belem. On the one hand Lisbon has much to offer the tourist that is very pleasing to the eye, including the Monastery. However, our experience visting the latter was coloured in not uncertain terms by the inordinately long queues to visit it. Having tried to pre-purchse tickets online in the Uk, then at our hotel reception with their assistance and finally from a ticket booth near the Belem Tower, without any success, we joined an already long queue to purchse tickets at the Monastery. We joined the queue at 9.45am, some 15 minutes before it opened, and finally got into the Monastery 1 hour 40 minutes later. Had we been able to pre-purchase tickets we'd have been able to enter the Monastery at 10.00am. Of particular concern was the very unhelpful attitude of personnel at the ticket booth near the Belem Tower, which I should say here and now was quite the opposite to the great service and assistance we experienced throughout the rest of our trip. Finally, if you real feel the need to visit these highly overrated cloisters rather than a monestery, then make sure you pre-purchase your tickets and try ro schedule your visit for late afternoon. Had we not experienced the excruciatingly long queue to visit the Monastery, it is likely we'd have only felt it merited 2 or at most 3 stars.","Written April 24, 2018","Kingston upon Thames, UK",Very Disappointing

This was not the case, not at the Monastery, or the palace, nor the Tower. Although we had prepaid tickets, through the Lisbon Card, this counted for zilch, as the queue was one and the same for those with and without tickets. We first waited for about 15 minutes without moving ahead more than a couple of feet, and thus returned at lunch time. The queue was shorter,  but we still had to wait about 30 minutes to get in. There were only 2 people selling tickets, which was the reason the queue was so slow moving.

If you go to the archaeological museum, which is where the queue tailed to, you can buy  joint ticket for museum and cloisters for 12 euros.

It is located about 40 minutes bus ride from central Lisbon and has few other sites like Belem tower nearby, so plan your day accordingly. There are very long (2 hours) queues to get in the monastery, however if you buy your tickets from the Archaeology museum in the next building it takes only 10 minutes, so my tip will be to buy your tickets from the Archaeology museum. Another important thing to know is that entrance to monastery church (Church of Santa Maria) is free, so if you just want to visit the church, do not bother buying the tickets. The ticket takes you inside other parts of the building like several rooms and choir of the monastery which are also equally charming like the church, so it is worth the price.","Written January 7, 2018","Kolkata (Calcutta), India",The most charming site in Lisbon

Patrick K,"The Jeronimos Monastery and Cathedral was our second stop with Lisbon Riders Small Group Tour. The architecture was crafted to reflect the nautical aspects of Portugal's seafaring explorers with ropes, shells, etc. on the walls and towering pillars. Many of Portugal's royals are in above ground crypts in the church as well as a poet and explorer. It was interesting that the tombs of the royalty rested on the backs of elephants to signify power of the royal house, while the tombs of the poet and explorer rested on lions to signify power. The difference was the royal family's love of elephants that caused the Portuguese to bring an elephant from India to Portugal via sailing ship for the King. Legend has it that the elephant also caused white limestone to be used in all sidewalks to avoid getting the elephants feet covered in mud when he was paraded - the black limestone is used within the white for decorative figures and words.","Written November 24, 2017","Atlantic Beach, FL",Amazing Architecture - Great History

Avoid the line (we learned the hard way after waiting almost an hour in an obnoxiously long line for the monastery). Go to the shorter line way over to the left for the ""Archaeology Museum"" and buy the combo ticket for the Archaeology Museum and Monastery there. it's only 2 Euro more and you will save an hour of waiting.

Staidthere,"When we arrived in an October afternoon, there were about 15 tour coaches parked in the coach parking lot, and there was a queue of people waiting to get in to the cloisters.  So we decided only to join the queue looking at the church, which was free but crowded, stuffy, and hardly moving. The church was beautiful, and the air outside of the church was cool and refreshing.  But we missed the cloisters which must have been impressive because it was the scene of the signing of the Lisbon Treaty by which Portugal formally joined the European Union in 1985. The church is unique with a bullet-shaped bell tower next to the steeples at one end of the cloisters.  Both the Monastery, which contains the tombs of Vasco da Gama and the poet Luis de Camoes, and the Tower of Belem are considered monuments to Portugal's Age of Discovery.  They are must-see tourist attractions and a part of every tour of Lisbon.","Written October 24, 2017","Jakarta, Indonesia",Giant monument to Portugal's glorious age

With that said, there wasn't as much on the inside as I had expected. There are a couple of rooms you can visit with focused exhibits, but otherwise it's just walking in circles above the courtyard. Given this, a ‚Ç¨10 admission fee felt a bit steep. Still, the beauty and history makes a visit here worthwhile.","Written October 24, 2017",Kansas City,"Worth It, Despite Steep Entry Fee"

There was a security guard there and I showed him my tickets and he opened up the rope and pointed and we walked right into the monastery. The architecture of the monastery is really beautiful.

MayLehmannNYC,"If there is a monument to Portugal's Age of Discovery, it is the remarkable Mosterio dos Jeronimos in Belem. It is only a short bus, train or cab ride from central Lisbon. While large and imposing, the monastery is still highly approachable. It is the height of Portugal's most distinctive architecture, Manueline. It was commissioned by King Manuel I in 1501 and completed by Jeronimo de Ruao. The monastery houses tombs to the men who made Portugal great, like Vasco da Gama. Highlights of this harmonious building are the cloister with its delicate tracery and richly-carved images, the tomb of King Sebastiao and its west (now the main entrance) and south portals. Both portals feature fantastical Renaissance decoration and historical figures. I would recommend getting to the monastery in advance of the 10:00 AM opening.

The cloister is very beautiful, the manueline architecture is special, but despite it, you won't see anything special. The best you can have is a good sight on the church that will allow you to take beautiful pictures.","Written August 10, 2017","Avezzano, Italy",Nothing Special

Chandra G,"A bit of a trip from the heart of downtown Lisbon, but completely worth it.  The architecture is quite stunning.  I'd recommend viewing this with the company of an explanatory text from a guidebook or online info, since the explanatory information in the site isn't very substantial and it is possible to miss some impressive sites if you don't know to look for them.  It kind of depends on what you're looking for.  It you just want a lovely building with great Manueline decoration, then it is worth it from an purely aesthetic perspective.  One hint - the lines to get directly into the building can be really long.  I highly recommend going nextdoor to the archaeology museum and buying the combo ticket.  The archaeology museum is excellent, and it opens directly into the monastery, meaning you can bypass the lines easily.

Admission is 10 Euro for the monastery or 12 Euro for both. The main chapel is free entry. Also, check out their website for discount rates for seniors, etc.They are easy walking distance apart, so buying a combined ticket is pretty much a given. Allow yourself time to view both, we unfortunately, arrived a bit late to get into the Tower. If you have only time to visit one, then make sure it is the Monastery. It requires more time but is definitely worth it. The Tower is still worth the visit, even if it is just to view the outside.

MHeredia,"The monastery is one of the highlights when visiting Lisboa. The best way to avoid a long wait is to go to the site later in the day. Check the monastery website to be sure of closing time which was 5:30pm when we were there. We arrived around 3:00 and the line was short, we waited about 10 minutes and got a combo ticket for both the monastery and Belem Tower. The cruise ship passengers arrive to these sites early in the day and the lines are very long. By going in the late afternoon you can avoid that as well as the crowds which hinder your movements through these sites. Once we got in we went to the cloister where we spent about 20 minutes taking pictures and then went to the church. It really is worth going inside to see the cloister. The carvings are gorgeous and walking through this part is just magical. It doesn't seem like much from the outside but once you are in you realize why it was worth the wait (although we waited 10 minutes). After you make the entire circle around the cloister follow the signs back out to the church. Here you will see the tomb of Vasco de Gama and Louis Camoes. It is also very beautiful inside and that late in the day there were only a handful of people inside the church.  It only took us about an hour to go through all of it and then we walked the underground underpass and went straight to Belem Tower. We had our combo ticket and therefore avoided the long line there.","Written August 1, 2017","Winter Springs, FL",Not to be missed!!!!

If it was cheaper and the queues were not as long I may have rated it higher as it's nice, but not great. It's ‚Ç¨10 but if you buy a double ticket for Belem Tower you get both for ‚Ç¨12, what they do not tell you until you reach the front of the queue is they do not sell the double tickets after 1.30pm as the queues at Belem Tower can take 3 hours so you would not have enough time if you bought it afrer 1.30pm (though when we went to Belem Tower the next day everyone with a a pre bought ticket was just walking to the front of the queue so if that is the procedure then we would of had time  - though I don't think they were supposed to but were pushing in which meant the queue just never moved at Belem)!

Built in the 16th century on the orders of king Manuel I, it stands on the former shore on the mouth of river Tagus wherefrom Vasco da Gama set out on the voyage that completed the  discovery of the sea route to India. It is a late Gothic building, with the peculiar Portuguese maritime decorative items - animals, plants, anchors, ropes, spheres - known as 'Manuelino' style. In front of Da Gama's tomb, right at the entrance of the monastery's church, you find the tomb of Camoens, Portugal's all time greatest poet. In the chapterhouse there is the tomb of the 19th century Romantic novelist and historian Alexandre Herculano and in the bright, beautiful cloysters the tomb of early 20th century acclaimed poet Fernando Pessoa - the keeper of Portugal's soul.

The place is a beautiful structure, along with the church (the church you can go into for free anyway).  But all you really get is the structure and the walk-around the beautiful courtyard.  Yes, there is hot room with a nice historical timeline of the monastery, along with parallel timelines of other world events but it is cumbersome (in my opinion) and you are pushed-along by other tourists, if you know what I mean.

You can't miss it - there will be coaches depositing their passengers on the huge open space in front of the wide frontage of the monastery. Get there in good time for it to open at 10.00 because you'll have to queue for entry. Get there later and the queue will probably be even longer. Ticket sales are not well organised, and this takes far more time than it need. But it's worth it once you're inside. The stone carving is exuberant and extravagant, especially on the double height cloister. Just look at the details, beautiful naturalistic designs including some humorous ones. The church is no less imposing with very tall columns and some fine tombs, including that of Vasco da Gama.

Once under the portico, you can see the stairs where you will be led to purchase your tickets.  Halfway up to the left is a room with a desk.  What they don't tell you is you can buy your tickets here ALSO!!!  Do that.  Same place.  Just a different kiosk.  AND once you buy there, you can enter.  That means you can pass by the the 25-50 people ahead of you that are waiting for the kiosk at the top.  Just understand that just because this is a religious place, people still don't behave well.  There are countries that produce tourists that always have cameras and pretend to not be able to read the signs.

And another person whose job is to check the ticket we just bought and also to let others squeeze into the line which we all have lined up for almost an hour. You get inside and you're on your own. The walls of the monastery has random numbers which might be for the audio guide -- who knows it was not advertised. The building itself is great -- five star to the 1500 folks who built it. But to those who are adding different things like history of Portugal, can you at least make it better? it's so frustrating when you're so excited to see a place and it's run by substandard folks.

The monks at the monastery created the famous Past√©is de nata in the 18th century.Monasteries and convents were closed in the 1820's so monks started to sell the pastries.

What prayers they must have offered up.  How different their lives were from those of a 21st century tourist.  The sense of timelessness and beauty of the stone and carving transcends the chatter and camera clicks of the current day.  The time and effort it took to carve each leaf, each tendril, each face or creature that speaks to you from each pillar speaks volumes about the dedication and toil of those far off workmen, who created a beauty that remains to this day.

The inner cloister is really crowded so if you love photography you need to be very very patient and even then you might not be able to take the shot you want. Nice decoration inside the cloister.

larkenRidgefield_CT,"This monastary was commissioned by Manuel I in 1501, after Vaco De Gama returned from his historic voyage. It was financed by ""pepper money"" or tax money levied on spices, precious stones and gold. The monastery was cared for by the Order of St Jerome until they were disbanded in 1834.The place is truly a work of art. In the blocks laid throughout you can see symbols which tell one those were the work of a particular man. It was a way those overseeing the building of the monastery could account  for one's work ethic.The carvings in the cloister are each a piece of art.The fountain in the shape of a lion is the animal of St Jerome. Vasco de Gama is buried here as are some notable others.The church of Santa Maria in the monastary has a spectacular vaulted ceiling..

The cloisters and surrounding rooms (chapter house, refectory, and so on) are full of amazing stonework, so spend a little extra time to take in all the little details. There are several informative displays in certain chambers that help tie all the history together. The balcony of the church is also accessed from the upper level of the cloisters. The main floor of the church is a separate entrance near the main ticket counter (but not a separate fee). Again, the stonework is beautiful all along the columns and rib vaulting.

prufrock2,"The monastery is perhaps the second most significant portugueses monument, all made of limestone and decorated with motives linked to the maritime discoveries of the portuguese. As usual in monasteries  a church and a cloister attract the most attention and display delicate stone work dating from the 16th century. Not longer with its steps on the river Tejo due to landfill, it is connected to a construction dated of much later (XIX century) where  the Etnographic  and the  Navy Museums are installed and has the Tower of Belem and other monumnents as its neighbors (see photo). In the church of Jeronimos two tombs can be seen  that epitomize the splendor of  times past : 1)that of the epic poet Lu√≠s de Cam√µes, deceased at the verge of the loss of the indepence of Portugal, at the end of the 16th century, and 2) that of Vasco da Gama who led the navigators around the Good Hope Cape into India for the first time in 1492. A visit that leads to a double reflection: A) How could such a small kingdom assert itself in various domains across the globe, for so long?, and B)Why did Portugal  lose so fast not only its geopolitical power, as dive into poverty and illiteracy of all types that led it to some of the worst indicators in the western world?

This is a three-aisled church with five bays under a single vault. The roof is supported by 25-metre-high, slender columns.

There are also tombs of other Portuguese historical figures as you walk around. However, I will have to read up on these before my next visit.

It is only a short tram ride from Lisbon (take the 15E but make sure you get off at Belem-Jeronimos, one stop after the main Belem stop or you will have to walk a bit further). The stonework is amazing and there are some interesting displays on the history. The line to get in was quite large when we arrived but it moved quickly (we also discovered that there is a second ticket office inside in the museum, so go there if you can!). It was pretty busy with tourists so if you are looking to escape for some calm this is not the place to go in peak season.

BeastiePV,"Don't want to wait long in line? Don't want the crowds? We were the first ones in today, tip toeing into the empty cloister, refectory, and chapter room, surrounded by magnificent architecture and near silence. You can do it too. Get there early before 10am and stand in the line at the West entrance of the church. No matter that you are not among the first 30 in line. The secret? There are two ticket sales desks, the main one at the front of the line deep into that entryway; and another inside the same entrance at the left of the line within about 5 meters of the front of the building. We watched the desk open and swung to our left and were the first in line. Tickets in hand we walked to the front of the line (to the right) and walked right up to the ticket collector at the official entrance. Whether this works for you or not, get there early before the ticket offices open, because by the time we left the monastery around noon, the crowds were unbearable. Another tip: if you think like we did that the Tower of Belem was not worth the long wait in the sun, just buy a less expensive $10 ticket for entry into the monastery. If you want to just enter the church, you may do so at no cost as a tourist after 10am, or you may enter as a worshipper for one of the scheduled services. The church alone is breathtaking architecturally and historically. One more tip: do not miss the room on the top floor of the cloister that features a historical exhibit that is a presentation of the history of the monastery from its beginning in the 16th century to the present. It parallels that story with the history of the world at that time and the history of Portugal. To see the three paralleled provides learning worth spending an hour with.

How on earth did human beings build these structures with no power tools and earth-moving equipment?  It was splendid to behold.  They were preparing for some sort of service while we were there, so many of the young men in appropriate dress (priests? novitiates [is that the right word?] deacons?) were coming in with various musical instruments. Part of their costume was a humongous rosary, which reminded me of the ones the Dominican nuns wore when I was a child. Filled with columns and buttresses and all manner of accouterments one would expect in a grand cathedral.  Gorgeous statues, ornately carved woodwork, and most of all, an incredible feeling you can only experience in a church.  That was still there, even though the place was filled with noisy tourists.  Even if you can't go inside, it's worth a trip over to Belem just to see the magnificent and imposing exterior.

Timothy John D,"Externally its very impressive and to be honest internally its also beautiful....but.  When you visit you have an option to either go into certain areas free of charge or pay 10 euros each to visit more of the Monastery.  We paid the money and to be honest were slightly disappointed.  Everywhere else in Lisbon we felt we got more than our moneys worth but here somehow we didn't.  Its good, its impressive but its not worth 10 euros each.  The free bit is probably the most impressive bit, along with the outside view of the stonework which is also stunningly well done.  I think they allow you into about a quarter of the Monastery even for the extra money.  I don't want you to think we are penny pinching here, we are fine paying if we feel its worth it.  Pena palace in Sintra for example or Palacio Nacional da Ajuda in Belem - both worth more than we paid frankly.  I would advise family members to do the free bit and spend the 20 euros on a nice meal and a couple of glasses of wine.

It is also a huge tourist attraction making them oodles of money.  There are hundreds and hundreds of people in there at the same time.  Total silence is not a possibility.  It reminded me of school assemblies when people would go ""SHHHHH"" really loudly, making as much noise as those talking.  A guy at a microphone telling people to be quiet is just as intrusive as a bunch of tourists oooing and ahhing.  The rest of the building was architecturally gorgeous, but there was not much inside to look at.  It was very crowded and I found we were in and out quite quickly.

Go early in the day, as this place gets very busy and is susceptible to many tour parties who arrive at the front of the line and delay your entry while they are being processed. The museum is worth the additional cost. and explore the multi-location option ticketing system - that way you save money and only have to line up once. One of the intriguing exhibits was a panoramic display that looked at the history of the monastery, the history of Portugal, and the history of the world. The history of the building was interesting, the history of Portugal also of great interest; but most fascinating was the history of the world through Portuguese eyes - that was true educational. One of the things that is fascinating in Portugal is the recycling of heritage structures into different uses - whether it be a training school, a museum or a poussada.

RobertJE,It is not difficult to see why this is one of the most visited sights in Lisbon.  It is a truly impressive building.  We bought a combined ticket for the Mosteiro and the Torre de Belem which makes the price very reasonable.  It's a good idea to time your visit as the Mosteiro gets busy - I imagine that tour buses arrive early morning (stopping in Belem on their way to Sintra) or late afternoon (on their way back from a morning in Sintra).  We arrived shortly after midday on an April weekday and it was relatively quiet - when we left Belem some five hours later there seemed to be huge crowds of people around the Mosteiro.  There are two parts to the Mosteiro.  The 'church' is free to enter - entry being from the incredibly impressive south portal.  The church with its fan vaulted ceiling is a masterpeice and in case you wonder why people gather round a tomb at the ntrance to take photos it's because its the tomb of Vasco da Gama.  Even more impressive than the church are the Cloisters which you pay to enter.  We were there for well over an hour marvelling at the carvings and the sheer majesty of the place.

When you visit you have an option to either go into certain areas free of charge or pay 10 euros each to visit more of the Monastery.  We paid the money and to be honest were slightly disappointed.  Everywhere else in Lisbon we felt we got more than our moneys worth but here somehow we didn't.  Its good, its impressive but its not worth 10 euros each.  The free bit is probably the most impressive bit, along with the outside view of the stonework which is also stunningly well done.  I think they allow you into about a quarter of the Monastery even for the extra money.  I don't want you to think we are penny pinching here, we are fine paying if we feel its worth it.  Pena palace in Sintra for example or Palacio Nacional da Ajuda in Belem - both worth more than we paid frankly.

The timeline of the monastery's development and general Portuguese history is not until the end of the tour, but other than that, it is very well presented and the property is gorgeous.","Written June 27, 2016","NY, NY",Gorgeous stonework

Go early in the day, as this place gets very busy and is susceptible to many tour parties who arrive at the front of the line and delay your entry while they are being processed. The museum is worth the additional cost. and explore the multi-location option ticketing system - that way you save money and only have to line up once. One of the intriguing exhibits was a panoramic display that looked at the history of the monastery, the history of Portugal, and the history of the world. The history of the building was interesting, the history of Portugal also of great interest; but most fascinating was the history of the world through Portuguese eyes - that was true educational.

While waiting now in the much longer line, we took a close look at a shorter line to the right. It said Free Entrance to the church. Since this is all we really wanted to do we bailed out of the paying line and went through the free entrance, thus avoiding the whole UNESCO fiasco.

The details of carvings on the signature tall columns are very different, the nature of the iconography is different, even the light that diffused through the doors seemed different - more like the lighting of a film noir movie. :-) There is a 500-year old Christ on a Cross statue on the first floor, which is extremely beautiful and evocative. I stood in front of him for a few minutes, caputred completely by emotions. The monastry and the cloisters are exquisite, and on that warm October day, it glowed like a jewel against the bright blue cloudless sky! There was an excellent museum on the first floor of the monastry, which had a very interesting exhibit on the history of the monasty juxtaposed with the history of Portugal and the world. It kind of made us all goosebumpy--to see our last 500-year's history on one timeline. We also discovered Vasco da Gama's tomb at the back of the cathedral - which was an interesting moment, because I have seen the actual burial place in Kochi, Kerala. I will not lie - as a child of a post colonial nation, I did/do have issues, but it was educational to see how the other country viewed us. And from their point of view, to bravely set out on unknown seas to conquer distant nations on strange shores and to be the forefathers of globalisation was commendable indeed.

Coupleover70,"Lisbon is a contrast to southern Spain, more diverse, though they share similar histories. In the west of Lisbon (Belem area) are many important sites (we don't take the paid tours): Mosteiro dos Jeronimos, an UNESCO World Heritage site, is a monastery reflecting Portugal's exploration of the world and housing the tomb of Vasco da Gama who made it to India unlike Columbus. This is the best example of Manueline style of architecture; a sea related maritime elements or moldings resembling corals, carvings covered with sea weeds and algae, elements in ships as anchors, stone ropes and cables and instruments used for navigation. Another example of Manueline architecture along the Tejo River is Torre de Belem where da Gama embarked on his voyage to India in 1497 and where Columbus was forced ashore in a storm on his way back from his discovery of the Americas in 1493.","Written January 25, 2015","Silver Spring, MD",LIsbon's attractions

Dana B,"This Monastery is actually a much larger complex, from which there was carved out space for the Museum of Archaeology, as well as for the Maritime Museum. So what is presented as Monastery of Jer√≥nimos is in fact only the large cloister of it plus few adjacent rooms. The architecture, in Gothic style, is fantastic. One of the rooms contains some interesting tiling work - azulejos, so specific to Portugal. Also from here, there is access available to the choir of the Church itself (and which has its own entrance, free of charge). When I reached there one morning, there were people already in the line, even though it was almost an hour left till the opening. As it seems with the majority of such sights and museums in Portugal, the opening time was 10 AM, which I think would have been more useful from a tourist's point of view, if it was a bit earlier. The entrance fee I thought was a bit high, so one might consider getting a combined ticket with some of the other attractions mentioned above (the Museum of Archaeology, specifically) and others, within the same Monastery complex or nearby.","Written December 12, 2014","Toronto, Canada",nice old Monastery in Lisbon

aakbba,"Yes, very interesting, and glad I saw it. But compared with other places, it was not THE most amazing place. After spending already 12 days in Lisbon, I admit, it was the place with the most tourists. And interesting. But how about in the same neighborhood the Palacio Nacional Da Ajuda. That was the palace where the Royal Family lived until the end, ca. 1910. We were the only tourists there, the palace was very interesting, and the most surprising thing was, the history!! Here you have a building that is shaped like a square, with an open courtyard in the middle. The point though is the ""fourth"" wall, or wing. You stand there and wonder what happened? (have to see it from the outside, worth the walk around the building!) Were they in the process of demolishing it, and didn't finish, or did some disaster happen? And then you ask a guide inside and it seems unreal...don't want to spoil the story, just go, it is very interesting!! Absolutely, there are so many other castles, palaces, royal residences in Europe that are way superior. But Portugal is struggling through econominal hardships, (whatever the politics, let's leave them aside). So when you have a huge National Palace, that is listed under ""Lisbon"", but within walking distance of downton Belem, and no tourists in it, how can they keep up the restoration, expansion of the exhibitions, pay all the very friendly and helpful guides, well, when you have seen some of the downfall of Lisbon, you can't expect the places to compete with other royal residences in Europe.

LuizDutraNeto,"The ""Mosteiro dos Jer√≥nimos"" or simply the ""Jer√≥nimos"" is one of the most beautiful monasteries in the whole world! Visiting is a must and should never be missed while in Lisbon. Its construction, commanded by Portuguese King D. Manuel I, started between the 15th and the 16th centuries, right after navigator Vasco da Gama's return from his iconic voyage to India. It would not be wrong to mention that this magnificent Monastery, in the lovely manueline gothic style, celebrates the grandiosity of the Portuguese discoveries, as well the huge profits obtained from the spice trade. Inside ""Mosteiro dos Jer√≥nimos"", many of the Portuguese heroes and artists are buried: King D. Manuel I, Navigator Vasco da Gama and Poets/Writers Lu√≠s de Cam√µes, Alexandre Herculano and Fernando Pessoa, and many others. ""Jer√≥nimos"" is a Portuguese National Monument since 1907 and has been appointed by Unesco, in 1983, as a World Heritage. The entrance to the Monastery is free, but admissions to Sacristy and Cloisters are charged. I would skip the Sacristy (that you can admire from a certain distance), but the Cloisters are definitely a must see! Combine the visit with other nearby mythical monuments: ""Torre de Bel√©m"", ""Padr√£o dos Descobrimentos"" and the ""Museu Nacional dos Coches"".

It is a typical Portuguese style (you won't see it anywhere else) and this monastery gives you a really clear idea about what Manueline style is. It is a very peaceful place and once you've seen it, you must walk down the road to Pasteis de Belem for Lisbon's best Pastel de Nata (we got the tip from a local Lisbonese, and it is well worth taking. It is cheap, old setting with plenty of room in the back and, honestly, the best Pastel de Nata in Lisbon).

Combine this with a visit to the church next door and see where Vasco de Gama is buried.,"Written February 9, 2012",Vietnam,A beautiful peaceful place
EvaGk,Impressive as a monument decorated with elaborate stone carvings and an important part of Lisbon's history it seems. Entry is free until 2pm on Sundays and there is also an antiques market until late afternoon on the park outside.

MALKYPOO,"We had previously visited the church adjacent to the monastery to view the tomb of Vasco De Gama and came back the next day to tour the monastery.  It was well worth the re-visit.  A beautiful building, not damaged by the earthquake of 1755, to take your breath away with its majesty and tranquility.","Written January 5, 2012","Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia",Sublime
fredericoalvares,Very nice place . The architecture is amazing and it is dated back to the beginning of 16th century.

debora g,"What is most beautiful Manueline architecture in Lisbon. A must visit! The cloister is really beautiful.

greenpanther30,"Wow what a venue, clearly the best thing to do in Belem and a must if you are visiting this area of Lisbon! It cost 7 Euros for each adult to enter the cloister and the museum area. The actual Church is free, but you simply must visit the Cloister! I've seen many cathedrals and cloisters in many different countries, and this has to be the most dramatic and stunning! Being on two levels and being so incredibly ornate just adds to the romantic atmosphere. It was raining when we visited and the animal gargoyles which are dotted all over spat out the rainwater from their ever open mouths!!! The various museums detailing both the history of the monastery and of Lisbon are well worth 30 minutes! Do take your time wondering around the cloister, it is a place you need to simply sit back and marvel at what man is capable of creating! The gallery looking out over the church is a must, just lovely views...","Written November 11, 2011","Camberley, UK",Stunning Cloister and great atmosphere!
Carno,"We fortified ourselves in the cafe which sells the original secret recipe custard tarts, then set off for the monastery.  It was hard to dodge the coach parties, so I dread to think what it would have been like in high season.","Written October 21, 2011","Southampton, UK",Well preserved if a little crowded
preppytraveler09,"We went to Belem the first afternoon after arriving from the US (so we were a bit tired but it was still great).  The Monastery was the highlight of Lisbon in general and definitely the best of Belem.  It is so old, yet incredibly ornate.  We are Catholic, but it would be a place of interest for anyone.   The inside architecture is incredible that is was built so long ago.  We just went in the church which was free, it looked like there was another section that was more like a museum that was a couple euros.","Written September 20, 2011","Saint Louis, MO",Gorgeous Church
